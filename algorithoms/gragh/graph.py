 # what is Graph: Graph consists of two vertices (nodes) and a set of edges connecting these vertices. check visualization\graph\graph.png

 # Graph Terminologies:
    # - Vertices (vertex): the nodes of the graph. check visualization\graph\graph.png
    # - Edge: the line that connects the pairs of vertices. check visualization\graph\graph.png 
    # - Unweighted Graph: does not have weights associated with any edge.
    # - Weighted Graph: has weights associated with any edge. check visualization\graph\weightedGraph.png
    # - Undirected Graph: does not have directions associated with any edge.
    # - Directed Graph: has directions associated with any edge. check visualization\graph\directedGraph.png
    # - Cyclic Graph: has at least one loop. check visualization\graph\cyclicGraph.png
    # - Acyclic Graph: has no loop. check visualization\graph\acyclicGraph.png
    # - Tree: it's a special case of directed acyclic graph. check visualization\graph\tree.png
