# Type of Sorting:
    # Space Used: 
        # In Place: no need for extra space. ex: Bubble sort.
        # Out of Place: uses extra space. ex: Merge sort
    # Stability: check visualization\stability.png/stability2.png.
        # Stable: if a sorting algorithm after sorting the contents does not change the sequence of similar content in which they appear, then it's called stable sorting. ex: Insertion sort.
        # Unstable: if a sorting algorithm after sorting the contents changes the sequence of similar content in which they appear, then it's called unstable sorting. ex: Quick sort.

# Sorting Terminology:
    # Increasing Order: 
        # - (ascending) If a successive element is greater than the previous one.
        # - ex: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,,,
    # Decreasing Order:
        # - (descending) If a successive element is less than the previous one.
        # - ex: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,,,,
    # Non increasing Order:
        # If successive element is less than or equal to its previous one.
        # ex: 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1,,,,
    # Non Decreasing Order:
        # If successive element is greater than or equal to its previous one.
        # ex: 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5,,,,

# Which algorithm to choose: based on: 1- stability. 2- Space efficient. 3- time efficient.
